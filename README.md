8080a emulator

What does SIEmu do?  Well, its is an 8080a simulator that allows you to play Space Invaders and it's many 8080a related clones!  That's not the main attraction of this project.  While developing this project, I focused on making it the best documentated 8080a simulator around. If you are interested in arcade game simulation (or emulation, as it's commonly called), read the report and grab the source and try it out.  No roms are included with these packages.
